# PasswordGenerator

**PasswordGenerator** is a Python script designed to generate secure and customizable passwords. It allows users to specify the number of passwords to generate and the length of each password. The generated passwords are randomized, with options for incorporating numbers and uppercase letters for enhanced security.

## Features

- **Customizable Password Lengths:** Users can define the length of each password, with a minimum length of 4 characters.
- **Randomized Characters:** The script generates passwords using lowercase letters, with options to replace some characters with numbers and uppercase letters.
- **Multiple Passwords:** Users can generate multiple passwords in a single run.

## How It Works

1. **User Input:** The user specifies the number of passwords and the length for each.
2. **Password Generation:** The script generates passwords using lowercase alphabets. It replaces some characters with numbers and uppercase letters to enhance security.
3. **Display:** The generated passwords are displayed to the user.

## Example

```bash
Enter the number of passwords you want to generate: 3
Generating 3 passwords.
Minimum length of password should be 4
Enter the length of Password #1 : 8
Enter the length of Password #2 : 6
Enter the length of Password #3 : 10
Password #1 = b7c4gHt3
Password #2 = abc3Ef
Password #3 = a8dBcfHkz1
```

## Code Overview

- `generatePassword(pwLeangth)`: Generates a list of passwords based on the specified lengths.
- `replaceWithNum(pword)`: Replaces some characters in the password with numbers.
- `replacewithUpperCase(pword)`: Replaces some characters in the password with uppercase letters.
- `main()`: The main function that interacts with the user to generate the passwords.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
